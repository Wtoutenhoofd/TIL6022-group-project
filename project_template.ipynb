    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "Crowd management is an important aspect to ensure safety, efficiency, and a pleasant experience for visitors during large public events. It is an essential element to monitor in order to keep everything running smoothly and to prevent dangerous overcrowding.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning models, it has become possible to predict crowd movement and density over short periods of time. These technologies allow event organisers to anticipate changes in crowd behaviour and respond proactively to potential risks.\n",
    "There are several factors that can influence crowd movement and intensity during an event. These depend mainly on the type of event, its layout, location, and schedule. External factors such as weather conditions can also have a significant impact on crowd dynamics. Therefore, it is important to monitor these variables closely and understand how they affect the safety and flow of visitors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The SAIL event in Amsterdam is the largest nautical event in the world, attracting millions of visitors over several days. With thousands of ships and activities taking place both on land and on the water, ensuring safe and efficient crowd movement is a critical challenge in such a large-scale urban environment. Accurate and timely crowd predictions are therefore essential to guarantee the safety of visitors and to support effective crowd management.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This study looks at the SAIL 2025 event in Amsterdam and uses its data, with the aim of developing a short-term crowd prediction model (5–15 minutes ahead) to forecast crowd density and movement patterns in the IJhaven and surrounding event areas. In particular, the study focuses on providing actionable insights for proactive crowd management, early-warning of congestion, and improving overall safety and visitor experience during this large-scale urban nautical event.  \n",

    "Specific: The study focuses on the SAIL 2025 event, making use of collected real-time and contextual data to model and predict crowd behaviour, focusing on one specific location (Amsterdam) and one time period (20-24 of August 2025).  \n",

    "Measurable: Predictions will be compared against real-world observations to accurately assess model performance.  \n",
